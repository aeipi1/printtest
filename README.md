# flush-print-testing

Just testing how printing works and how flushing works
Turns out it won't update the text file unless there's heaps of data to flush (it'll do it automatically) or if you manually flush it
So depending on when you stop the program, some files will be empty while others won't be...

Mainly, I'm testing how to get my VM to upload files to GIT. This is a dummy project.
